title:Appealing properties
1. It incorporates local neighborhood information; 
2. it can be stacked applied to learn global shape properties; 
3. in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space captures semantic characteristics over potentially long distances in the original embedding.

title:Problem
 Most critically, standard deep neural network models require input data with regular structure, while point clouds are **fundamentally irregular**: Point positions are continuously distributed in the space, and any permutation of their ordering does not change the spatial distribution
